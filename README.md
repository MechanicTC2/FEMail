# FEMail
 An all new mail system in Minecraft!
 
 Tired of the boring old chat? Tired of constantly typing /msg or /w to people?
 Or even admin abusers checking the console and seeing your chats with others?
 Well now you can directly message them with no evidence left behind, with FEMail.
 FEMail uses the book and quill to create a customized message to your recipient.
 
 HOW TO USE:
 
 When you open the book and quill called "Message Book", you can type anything to your heart's content!
 When you sign the book, make sure to save the title as your targeted username.
 The FEMail system will open, and should take you from there!
 
 
 Enjoy the brand new FEMail mail system in Minecraft!!!
